# Initial setup

To kick off with the plugin creation for 7-Zip you have two option available.
1. *(Easy)* You can go to the releases section on GitHub and find `Plugin API vXX.X` and download `plugin_headers_vXX.XX`. Extract this folder into your project and you can start implementing plugins for 7zip. Please be aware that `7z-assembly.h` files has declarations only. Do not forget to implement the required declarations. Continue from the next [section](#understanding-the-7-zip-plugin-system).
1. *(Hard)* You can follow the [instructions](#getting-along-with-the-7-zip-source-code) to build up the initial infrastructure by yourself.

### Getting along with the 7-Zip source code

First we need to download the 7-Zip source code. It is located on the [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/). Go to the `Files` -> `7-Zip` -> `Version` -> `***-src.7z` and download the archive. After download and extracting the source code we can search for the definition files and find `CPP/7zip/Archive/Archive.def` and `CPP/7zip/Archive/Archive2.def`. It appears that there are multiple versions of the plugins available. We will use the second one as it seems to be specially designed for the new plugins. Here is the content of the `Archive2.def`:

```def
EXPORTS
  CreateObject PRIVATE
  GetHandlerProperty PRIVATE
  GetNumberOfFormats PRIVATE
  GetHandlerProperty2 PRIVATE
  GetIsArc PRIVATE
  GetNumberOfMethods PRIVATE
  GetMethodProperty PRIVATE
  CreateDecoder PRIVATE
  CreateEncoder PRIVATE
  GetHashers PRIVATE
  SetCodecs PRIVATE
  SetLargePageMode PRIVATE
  SetCaseSensitive PRIVATE
  GetModuleProp PRIVATE
```

We will search for all of the methods defined in the definition file and will copy function signatures to the `7z-assembly.h` file. After copying the definitions we must add the missing includes. I will place this files in the `./src/plugins/` directory to organize everything in one place. In addition to that I will create in `Export.h` inside of the plugins directory to have just one `#include` in the `7z-assembly.h` file. When I copy files from the 7-zip source code archive I update the `#include`'s to reference local files neglecting the source code directory structure. Here is the list of the definitions I have assembled from the 7-zip source code archive:

```cpp
STDAPI_LIB CreateObject(const GUID *clsid, const GUID *iid, void **outObject);
STDAPI_LIB GetHandlerProperty(PROPID propID, PROPVARIANT *value);
STDAPI_LIB GetNumberOfFormats(UINT32 *numFormats);
STDAPI_LIB GetHandlerProperty2(UInt32 formatIndex, PROPID propID, PROPVARIANT *value);
STDAPI_LIB GetIsArc(UInt32 formatIndex, Func_IsArc *isArc);
STDAPI_LIB GetNumberOfMethods(UInt32 *numCodecs);
STDAPI_LIB GetMethodProperty(UInt32 codecIndex, PROPID propID, PROPVARIANT *value);
STDAPI_LIB CreateDecoder(UInt32 index, const GUID *iid, void **outObject);
STDAPI_LIB CreateEncoder(UInt32 index, const GUID *iid, void **outObject);
STDAPI_LIB GetHashers(IHashers **hashers);
STDAPI_LIB SetCodecs(ICompressCodecsInfo *compressCodecsInfo)
STDAPI_LIB SetLargePageMode();
STDAPI_LIB SetCaseSensitive(Int32 caseSensitive)
STDAPI_LIB GetModuleProp(PROPID propID, PROPVARIANT *value);
```

I have defined the `STDAPI_LIB` as `as` to make them exported from the library. I am using the cmake `GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER` function to define the `LIB_EXPORT` macro.
